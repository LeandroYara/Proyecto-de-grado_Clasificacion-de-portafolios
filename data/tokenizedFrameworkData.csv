0,A Dashboard to Support Management of Business Analytics Capabilities,"Business analytics (BA) systems create value and provide competitive advantage for organisations. They involve technology and data infrastructure, BA capabilities and business processes that provide useful insights and support decision-making. To provide value and competitive advantage, BA capabilities should be valuable, rare and inimitable, and have organisational support (VRIO). In this paper, we develop and evaluate a prototype dashboard for the VRIO assessment of BA capabilities. The dashboard is intended to support the strategic management of BA capabilities. We discuss implications of the prototype dashboard for researchers and practitioners and suggest directions for future research. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

1,"Project portfolio selection problems: A review of models, uncertainty approaches, solution techniques, and case studies","Project portfolio selection has been the focus of many scholars in the last two decades. The number of studies on the strategic process has significantly increased over the past decade. Despite this increasing trend, previous studies have not been yet critically evaluated. This paper, therefore, aims to presents a comprehensive review of project portfolio selection and optimization studies focusing on the evaluation criteria, selection approach, solution approach, uncertainty modeling, and applications. This study reviews more than 140 papers on project portfolio selection research topic to identify the gaps and to present future trends. The findings show that not only the financial criteria but also social and environmental aspects of project portfolios have been focused by researchers in project portfolio selection in recent years. In addition, meta-heuristics and heuristics approach to finding the solution of mathematical models have been the critical research by scholars. Expert systems, artificial intelligence, and big data science have not been considered in project portfolio selection in the previous studies. In future, researchers can investigate the role of sustainability, resiliency, foreign investment, and exchange rates in project portfolio selection studies, and they can focus on artificial intelligence environments using big data and fuzzy stochastic optimization techniques. © 2019 The Author(s).

2,A decision-making framework for project portfolio planning at Intel Corporation,"The work we describe addresses the problem of deciding between project-funding opportunities under budget and headcount constraints. Although the projects lead to products that yield revenue in the market, complex interactions between the projects and products make the selection of a portfolio difficult. Furthermore, the senior managers in the company have a wealth of business intuition that can inform the required decisions. We combine modeling, simulation, and optimization techniques to provide a set of the best portfolios possible from the proposed projects and resulting products. We also provide a rich set of analysis and visualization tools for the decision makers to use in exploring the suggested portfolios and applying their intuition to make the final selection. The resulting interplay between analytics and intuition produces better business solutions through a more focused and effective debate in a shorter time than previously achieved. © 2015 INFORMS.

3,Big data analytics in innovation processes: which forms of dynamic capabilities should be developed and how to embrace digitization?,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze, from a dynamic capabilities perspective, the role of big data analytics in supporting firms' innovation processes. 
Design/methodology/approach: Relevant literature is reviewed and critically assessed. An interpretive methodology is used to analyze empirical data from interviews of big data analytics experts at firms within digitally related sectors. 
Findings: This study shows how firms leverage big data to gain “richer” and “deeper” data at the inter-sections between the digital and physical worlds. The authors provide evidence for the importance of counterintuitive strategies aimed at developing innovative products, services or solutions with characteristics that may initially diverge, even significantly, from established customer/user needs. 
Practical implications: The authors’ findings offer insights to help practitioners manage innovation processes in the physical world while taking investments in big data analytics into account. 
Originality/value: The authors provide insights into the evolution of scholarly research on innovation directed toward opportunities to create a competitive advantage by offering new products, services or solutions diverging, even significantly, from established customer demand. © 2021, Rosita Capurro, Raffaele Fiorentino, Stefano Garzella and Alessandro Giudici.

4,A Data-driven project categorization process for portfolio selection,"Purpose: Categorizing projects allows for better alignment of a portfolio with the organizational strategy and goals. An appropriate project categorization helps understand portfolio’s structure and enables proper project portfolio selection (PPS). In practice, project categorization is, however, conducted in intuitive approaches. Furthermore, little attention has been given to project categorization methods in the project management literature. The purpose of this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners with a data-driven project categorization process designed for PPS. Design/methodology/approach: The suggested process was modeled considering the main characteristics of project categorization systems revealed from the literature. The clustering analysis is used as the core-computing technology, allowing for an empirically based categorization. This study also presents a real-world case study in the automotive industry to illustrate the proposed approach. Findings: This study confirmed the potential of clustering analysis for a consistent project categorization. The most important attributes that influenced the project grouping have been identified including strategic and intrinsic features. The proposed approach helps increase the visibility of the portfolio’s structure and the comparability of its components. Originality/value: There is a lack of research regarding project categorization methods, particularly for the purpose of PPS. A novel data-driven process is proposed to help mitigate the issues raised by prior researchers including the inconsistencies, ambiguities and multiple interpretations related to the taken-for-granted categories. The suggested approach is also expected to facilitate projects evaluation and prioritization within appropriate categories and contribute in PPS effectiveness. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

5,How to measure and manage the UK Government’s major project portfolio,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to stimulate changes to the way performance data is used to improve performance taking the government’s use of project data as an example. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses systems theory to review the way the government’s major projects portfolio should be analysed. Findings: This paper concludes that broader engagement in the analytics process should be considered as a way of improving insights and learning from reviews. The paper suggests that report alone has limited value. Research limitations/implications: By taking a systems approach, this study raises questions about the methods used to manage data analysis and system improvements. Systems thinking is a useful tool to consider applications such as the performance of the government’s project portfolio, but there are many other approaches that can be applied. Practical implications: This study makes very specific recommendations around the roles and responsibilities of people and teams at different levels in the system. Roles and activities are described together with recommendations about interfering in and overreaching these roles and activities. Originality/value: This paper synthesises a number of systems approaches together with a view of why “we measure” to create a framework for analysing approaches to performance improvement. The practical application provided here gives insights into how these approaches can be used in real-life contexts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

6,Machine learning in project analytics: a data-driven framework and case study,"The analytic procedures incorporated to facilitate the delivery of projects are often referred to as project analytics. Existing techniques focus on retrospective reporting and understanding the underlying relationships to make informed decisions. Although machine learning algorithms have been widely used in addressing problems within various contexts (e.g., streamlining the design of construction projects), limited studies have evaluated pre-existing machine learning methods within the delivery of construction projects. Due to this, the current research aims to contribute further to this convergence between artificial intelligence and the execution construction project through the evaluation of a specific set of machine learning algorithms. This study proposes a machine learning-based data-driven research framework for addressing problems related to project analytics. It then illustrates an example of the application of this framework. In this illustration, existing data from an open-source data repository on construction projects and cost overrun frequencies was studied in which several machine learning models (Python’s Scikit-learn package) were tested and evaluated. The data consisted of 44 independent variables (from materials to labour and contracting) and one dependent variable (project cost overrun frequency), which has been categorised for processing under several machine learning models. These models include support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour, random forest, stacking (ensemble) model and artificial neural network. Feature selection and evaluation methods, including the Univariate feature selection, Recursive feature elimination, SelectFromModel and confusion matrix, were applied to determine the most accurate prediction model. This study also discusses the generalisability of using the proposed research framework in other research contexts within the field of project management. The proposed framework, its illustration in the context of construction projects and its potential to be adopted in different contexts will significantly contribute to project practitioners, stakeholders and academics in addressing many project-related issues. © 2022, The Author(s).

8,"A new strategic approach for R&D
project portfolio selection using
efficiency-uncertainty maps","Purpose – New business practices and the globalization of markets force firms to take innovation as the
fundamental pillar of their competitive strategy. Research and Development (R&D) plays a vital role in innovation. As technology advances and product life cycles become shorter, firms rely on R&D as a strategy to invigorate innovation. R&D project portfolio selection is a complex and challenging task. Despite the management’s efforts to implement the best project portfolio selection practices, many projects continue to fail or miss their target. The problem is that selecting R&D projects requires a deep understanding of strategic vision and technical capabilities. However, many decision-makers lack technological insight or strategic vision. This article aims to provide amethod to capitalize on the expertise of R&Dprofessionals to assistmanagers inmaking informed and effective decisions. It also provides a framework for aligning the portfolio of R&D projects with the organizational vision and mission.
Design/methodology/approach – This article proposes a new strategic approach for R&D project portfolio
selection using efficiency-uncertainty maps.
Findings – The proposed strategy plane helps decision-makers align R&D project portfolios with their strategies to combine a strategic view and numerical analysis in this research. The proposed strategy plane consists of four areas: Exploitation Zone, Challenge Zone, Desperation Zone and Discretion Zone. Mapping the project into this strategic plane would help decision-makers align their project portfolio according to the corporate perspectives.
Originality/value – The new approach combines the efficiency and uncertainty dimensions in portfolio selection into an integrated framework that: (i) provides a complete representation of the stochastic decision-making processes, (ii) models the endogenous uncertainty inherent in the project selection process and (iii) proposes a computationally practical and visually unique solution procedure for classifying desirable and undesirable R&D projects.

10,Unified business intelligence ecosystem: A project management approach to address business intelligence challenges,"The purpose of this paper is to explore a concept that improves the success rate of Business Intelligence projects by looking at it as an ecosystem rather than standalone project. This paper discusses the importance on Business Intelligence (BI) initiatives and today's challenges in implementing them. The concentration is on using proven practices of project management to reduce the failure rates of the Business Intelligence projects by evaluating currently existing Information Technology (IT) project process, Business Intelligence frameworks and a Project Vulnerability process in order to adopt some of the best project management practices that works for Business Intelligence projects. The paper studies currently existing processes and introduces a new concept which henceforth will be termed as 'Unified Business Intelligence Ecosystem' framework (UBIE). This research is based on various project management frameworks, those are proven to increase the efficiency of projects, and far-ranging sources of research on nature of Business Intelligence projects, personal observations and real-world Business Intelligence consulting experience. Research limitations/implications: Business Intelligence is a constantly developing field. Partial standardization and extensive availability and access to Business Intelligence resources has created many definitions and buzz words in the industry. The assumptions described in this research might seem arguable given the reader's experience in this field. Originality/value: The paper presents a different perspective to view and manage Business Intelligence projects. It encourages to interpret Business Intelligence projects as an ecosystem by combining technical, business and management aspect rather than separate, standalone entity. The aim of this research paper is to achieve Business Intelligence success by customizing Project Management (PM) practices to fit the unique need of Business Intelligence projects.

11,Simulation of adaptive project management analytics,"Typically, IT projects are delivered over-budget and behind schedule. In this paper, we explore the effects of common project management practices that contribute to these problems and suggest a better alternative that can utilize resources more effectively. Our alternative approach uses (a) a thorough analysis of risks affecting activities in a project plan (i.e., the root factors leading to cost and time overruns), and (b) an optimization of the resources allocated to each activity in the project plan to maximize the probability of on time and within budget project completion. One key feature of our method is its capability to adapt and learn the risk factors affecting activities during the course of the project, enabling project managers to reallocate resources dynamically to ensure a better outcome given the updated risk profile. We use simulations to test the performance of our optimization algorithm and to gain insights into the benefits of adaptive re-planning. © 2007 IEEE.

12,A survey study of success factors in data science projects,"In recent years, the data science community has pursued excellence and made significant research efforts to develop advanced analytics, focusing on solving technical problems at the expense of organizational and socio-technical challenges. According to previous surveys on the state of data science project management, there is a significant gap between technical and organizational processes. In this article we present new empirical data from a survey to 237 data science professionals on the use of project management methodologies for data science. We provide additional profiling of the survey respondents' roles and their priorities when executing data science projects. Based on this survey study, the main findings are: (1) Agile data science lifecycle is the most widely used framework, but only 25% of the survey participants state to follow a data science project methodology. (2) The most important success factors are precisely describing stakeholders' needs, communicating the results to end-users, and team collaboration and coordination. (3) Professionals who adhere to a project methodology place greater emphasis on the project's potential risks and pitfalls, version control, the deployment pipeline to production, and data security and privacy. © 2021 IEEE.

13,Paradise by the dashboard light: Designing governance metrics in turbulent environments,"One of the emerging sweet-spots in business intelligence (BI) and business performance management (BPM) projects is the design of metrics (dashboards) in such a way that they balance the need for ""inward focused"" operational management with the need for ""outward-focused"" strategic management. Unfortunately, hitting this sweet spot often proves to be a difficult process, particularly in more turbulent environments. This article aims to understand the forces at work in the design process of these metrics using two starkly contrasting case studies involving the design of dashboards for IT departments, specifically for IT governance which concerns the alignment between business and IT. The first case explores metrics design for an organization with low external and high internal turbulence (a German insurance company), the second contrasting case focuses on a similar metrics design process but now for an organization facing low internal turbulence and high external turbulence (an African national government). Our findings suggest how the source of project turbulence impacts the success of the metrics design process, the bias towards more inward-focused or outward-focused metrics, and the overall outcomes of the project. © 2012 IEEE.

17,Predicting Project Outcomes with the Association of Project Management,"Project professionals place great value in accurately predicting project outcomes. Itis therefore unsurprising that there has been a rapid acceptance of a new suite of tools promising to forecastproject outcomes better than ever before. Within a few years the use of project data analytics has become widespread throughout project delivery organisations; they have become the norm. Most closely associated with dashboards,project data analytics is transforming projects' ability to see problems sooner and act quicker. Project data analytics however has not yet been 'professionalised'. No single organisation has yet solved how to holistically get the very best out of analytics to deliver more predictable projects, but many are trying across multiple industries. Some organisations have great solutions and ideas, but itis not yet encoded in how the profession delivers. Petrofac as part of the Project Data Analytics Task Force [1&2], a cross industry working group, have collaborated with the Association of Project Management (APM) [3] to publish a ground-breaking guide[4] designed to help project delivery organisations get started in project data analytics. In addition, a five step framework*is offered which is designed for project delivery organisations who are further long their journey with analytics. This framework recommends the steps organisations can take to improve their project predictability from basic systems, through to dashboards and onto machine learning and artificial intelligence. It also references the capabilities organisations need to consider forthe benefits to become embedded. The paper explores how superior project performance is best achieved when project data analytics is blended with the insights and actions our people bring to delivering projects; to improve resultsthis blend of data and people is noted as being essential. The paper highlights this as the most significant factor as to why data analytics programmesmay not bring the value organisations expect and why step 4 (automated performance) of the model is seen as the pivot to success. On realisation of step 5 (intelligent performance), an organisation would be expected to have embraced the market leading approaches to maximising project performance and be well placed to achieve market leading returns on investment and margin. The paper advocates that organisations should: • Adopt a 3-click rule to project information • Send the right action, to the right person, at the right time • Blend human and data insights by quantifying perceptions and makinginsights actionable • Automate Project Data Analytics into the working rhythm of project delivery This paper is deliberately aimed at the project professional and not the data science community. It simplifiesthe typical technical jargon around analytics and provides a wide variety of examples, tips and graphics that the project professional can easily relate to. *For clarity, the five step framework is solely the work of Petrofac and no third party organisation has either been asked to comment on or endorse this. No direct link should be inferred between the Petrofac framework and the Association of Project Management, the only connection is the author's involvement in both.

19,Integrating a Project Risk Model into a BI Architecture,"In today’s unpredictable and disruptive business landscape organizations face challenges that severely threatens their existence. To efficiently respond such challenges organizations must craft strategies to become more data-informed, agile, adaptative, and flexible. Integrating dynamic data analytical models in organizational structures to collect, analyze and interpret business data, is critical to organizations because it enables them to make more data-informed decisions and reduce bias in decision-making. In this work is illustrated the integration of a heuristic project risk-model used to identify project critical success factors into a typical organizational business intelligence architecture. The proposed integration enables organizations to efficiently and in a timely manner identify project collaborative risks by addressing people, environment, and tools, and generate actionable project-related knowledge that helps organizations to efficiently respond business challenges and achieve sustainable competitive advantages. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

20,Big Data in Portfolio Allocation: A New Approach to Successful Portfolio Optimization,"In the classic mean-variance portfolio theory as proposed by Harry Markowitz, the weights of the optimized portfolios are directly proportional to the inverse of the asset correlation matrix. However, most contemporary portfolio optimization research focuses on optimizing the correlation matrix itself, and not its inverse. In this article, the author demonstrates that this is a mistake. Specifically, from the Big Data perspective, she proves that the inverse of the correlation matrix is much more unstable and sensitive to random perturbations than is the correlation matrix itself. As such, optimization of the inverse of the correlation matrix adds more value to optimal portfolio selection than does optimization of the correlation matrix. The author further shows the empirical results of portfolio reallocation under different common portfolio composition scenarios. The technique outperforms traditional portfolio allocation techniques out of sample, delivering nearly 400% improvement over the equally weighted allocation over a 20-year investment period on the S&P 500 portfolio with monthly reallocation. In general, the author demonstrates that the correlation inverse optimization proposed in this article significantly outperforms the other core portfolio allocation strategies, such as equally weighted portfolios, vanilla mean-variance optimization, and techniques based on the spectral decomposition of the correlation matrix. The results presented in this article are novel in the data science space, extend far beyond financial data, and are applicable to any data correlation matrixes and their inverses, whether in advertising, healthcare, or genomics. © 2019 Pageant Media Ltd.

23,Using analytics to predict project management success,"IT projects normally face time and cost overruns challenges. Predicting which projects will not be completed by the expected end date (time overrun) and within the allotted number of hours (man-hours overrun) helps manage company's employee utilization and avoids overscheduling. This study applied a data analytics framework on IT project management dataset to predict the project completion time and overruns (in man-hours). We used linear regression and classification models to predict projects' performance and analyze the underlying factors causing project delay. Our predictive analysis used 131 variables which included 536 tasks, 138 resources, 69371 employee hours, 72 contractors that were assigned to 434 projects. We also calculated two new variables closeness and betweenness among project team members. Results showed that Decision Tree outperformed SVM, ANN, LDA, and logistic regression in predicting man-hours overrun. In addition, preliminary Social Network Analysis (SNA) indicates that Average-closeness and Average-betweenness did not improve prediction on the overall amount of time and man-hours overrun but improve the prediction on time overrun, but task, resource and contractor assignments variables were significant at p-value of .01. The models we used helps identify key predictors of project performance and provide insights into the company's resource management.

25,Use of Artificial Intelligence Smart Tools in Projects,"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gotten a lot of press and attention. Learning and adapting through constant algorithmic interventions aid in the development of a firm grasp of the situation at hand, as well as the handling of more difficult challenges as they arise. Cognitive psychology and knowledge-based applications engineering are at the heart of AI. AI-assisted quicker computing approaches are being used to address complex difficulties. Simultaneously, new, and more complicated issues emerge, which are difficult for the human mind to understand and envision, and which are far from being solved. Dynamic developments in global technical, economic, political, and environmental settings provide insurmountable challenges to corporate executives and strategists. Projects and project management are used to carry out business plans and government welfare goals. Throughout the project's timeframe, project managers must cope with restrictions. Regardless of methodology, predictive or iterative, the existence of various stakeholders and managing their requirements creates a slew of issues for the project manager and team. This paper aims to explain the existing industrial procedures employed by project managers that utilize AI principles.

29,Evaluation Criteria of Project Risk and Decision Making Through Beta Analysis and TOPSIS Towards Achieving Organizational Effectiveness,"Value of a project of an organization is primarily determined by two major factors – risk and return. The most important aspect of a business analysis, therefore, lies with the analysis of the risks and their associated returns. The basic objective of an organization is to increase the productivity to grab more market share. But the problem is that market risk is inherent in all projects and, by nature, it is stochastic. It can hardly be avoided but can be mitigated at most through diversification. Through Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the systematic or un-diversifiable risks can be described and measured by beta, ?. In order to mitigate the risk, investments are to be made on a combination of different projects or portfolio of projects rather than a single project. Through ?-hedging, a proper hedging strategy can be developed to reduce the systematic risk. But it has also been observed that the concept of CAPM has been plagued by the stochastic nature of the economy. Therefore, in the first part of this work, the systematic risk has been evaluated through time-varying ? analysis. According to the results of the hedge performance of individual projects of the portfolio, it will be possible to select/rank the projects according to their risk-return trade-off capacity and in the second part, the Technique for Order Preference using Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), one of the most important MCDM techniques, has been merged with CAPM in order to provide a more justified selection procedure of projects considering four more attributes, other than risk, which may confirm a more realistic basis of creating the portfolio for increasing organizational effectiveness.

Still, many industries face obstacles while leveraging data science to overcome business problems. This paper explores the development of a roadmapping approach to address data science challenges. Towards this goal, we customize technology roadmapping by synthesizing roadmapping, big data, data science, and data-driven organization literature. The resulting data science roadmapping approach links business strategy with data-related, technological, and organizational resources. It also enables communication, stakeholder buy-in, and project prioritization. While most of the existing studies illustrate prebuilt roadmaps, this study focuses on the process of roadmapping.

32,Business Value Creation Through Project Management Based on Big Data Approach,"In the era of big data, the high level of businesses’ digitalization, and new technology development in various fields, awash companies in a flood of massive amounts of data. Dealing with that fact is non more an option. Companies have to reexamine the way they do business in order to gain benefits from big data. Consequently, they have to review their approach of managing projects in order to create the added value. For the purpose of assessing this issue, we have adopted a research approach built on two phases. In the first, we have performed a systematic literature review to spot the gaps in the current research. The results have revealed that so far, no scientific work has discussed how companies can create business value through project management in a big data context. These results have also shown significant contributions of the research community on how big data contributes to value creation in organizations.

33,Probabilistic Approach to Predicting Risk in Software Projects Using Software Repository Data,"Although the factors that need to be focused on for a successful software project appear to be difficult to define, risk management has become one of the key activities for achieving such success because significant risk is involved in each software development phase. Software project failures are often a result of insufficient and ineffective risk information regarding the future. To overcome this, software risk prediction should be performed in advance to allow project managers insight into providing more valuable information for decision making, such as scope coverage, resource allocation, and schedule changes. In this research, we propose a risk prediction model from the perspective of quality using a software repository. We evaluated the risk threat level by mapping some defect attributes that exist in the defect lifecycle, defined their risk threat transition states, and applied a Markov chain for predicting the potential risk level. We evaluated the proposed approach using practical real-industry mobile software projects. The experimental results confirm that our approach is applicable to software threat risk estimation. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.

The focus is put on the novelty and usability of the obtained insights. However, the impact of a project can be seriously reduced if the results are not communicated well. In this paper, we describe a means of managing and describing the outcomes of the Data Science projects in such a way that they optimally convey the insights gained. We focus on the main artifact of the non-verbal communication, namely project structure. In particular, we surveyed three sources of information on how to structure projects: common management methodologies, community best practices, and data sharing platforms. The survey resulted in a list of recommendations on how to build the project artifacts to make them clear, intuitive, and logical. We also provide hints on tools that can be helpful for managing such structures in an efficient manner.

35,Key success factors in Business Intelligence,"Business Intelligence can bring critical capabilities to an organization, but the implementation of such capabilities is often plagued with problems. Why is it that certain projects fail, while others succeed? The aim of this article is to identify the factors that are present in successful Business Intelligence projects and to organize them into a framework of critical success factors. A survey was conducted during the spring of 2011 to collect primary data on Business Intelligence projects. Findings confirm that Business Intelligence projects are wrestling with both technological and non-technological problems, but the non-technological problems are found to be harder to solve as well as more time consuming than their counterparts. The study also shows that critical success factors for Business Intelligence projects are different from success factors for Information Systems projects in general. Business Intelligences projects have critical success factors that are unique to the subject matter. Major differences can be found primarily among non-technological factors, such as the presence of a specific business need and a clear vision to guide the project. Success depends on types of project funding, the business value provided by each iteration in the project and the alignment of the project to a strategic vision for Business Intelligence at large. Furthermore, the study provides a framework for critical success factors that, explains sixty-one percent of variability of success for projects. Areas which should be given special attention include making sure that the Business Intelligence solution is built with the end users in mind, that the Business Intelligence solution is closely tied to the company's strategic vision and that the project is properly scoped and prioritized to concentrate on the best opportunities first.

In such environment, the ability to respond effectively and adapt to the new requirements is not only desirable but essential to survive. Comprehensive and quick understanding of intricacies of market changes facilitates firm's faster and better response. Two concepts contribute to the success of this scenario; organizational agility and business intelligence (BI). As of today, despite BI's capabilities to foster organizational agility and consequently improve organizational performance, a clear link between BI and organizational agility has not been established.

68,Data assessment model for strategic management,"A data-oriented culture enables new ways of building competitive advantage, but also requires new type of managerial skills. Despite of fast-growing attention to data assets, there are very few managerial tools for the purpose. In this paper, we propose a new data assessment model for strategic management. The model makes the organization's analytical capabilities and development needs transparent. The model consists of three phases and uses an easily communicated four-field model for mapping existing data and discovering new possibilities. The model helps to identify what datasets the organization could use in analytics and to assess them according to their strategic importance. Therefore, organization's development resources can be targeted effectively. The relevancy of the model was discovered during empirical studies with regional organizations on business analytics maturity.
