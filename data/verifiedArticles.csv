Predicting Project Outcomes with the Association of Project Management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143059154&doi=10.2118%2f210795-MS&partnerID=40&md5=fef8335f784d88f60d7bc0c7e1b6d2f0,"Project professionals place great value in accurately predicting project outcomes. Itis therefore unsurprising that there has been a rapid acceptance of a new suite of tools promising to forecastproject outcomes better than ever before. Within a few years the use of project data analytics has become widespread throughout project delivery organisations; they have become the norm. Most closely associated with dashboards,project data analytics is transforming projects' ability to see problems sooner and act quicker. Project data analytics however has not yet been 'professionalised'. No single organisation has yet solved how to holistically get the very best out of analytics to deliver more predictable projects, but many are trying across multiple industries. Some organisations have great solutions and ideas, but itis not yet encoded in how the profession delivers. Petrofac as part of the Project Data Analytics Task Force [1&2], a cross industry working group, have collaborated with the Association of Project Management (APM) [3] to publish a ground-breaking guide[4] designed to help project delivery organisations get started in project data analytics. In addition, a five step framework*is offered which is designed for project delivery organisations who are further long their journey with analytics. This framework recommends the steps organisations can take to improve their project predictability from basic systems, through to dashboards and onto machine learning and artificial intelligence. It also references the capabilities organisations need to consider forthe benefits to become embedded. The paper explores how superior project performance is best achieved when project data analytics is blended with the insights and actions our people bring to delivering projects; to improve resultsthis blend of data and people is noted as being essential. The paper highlights this as the most significant factor as to why data analytics programmesmay not bring the value organisations expect and why step 4 (automated performance) of the model is seen as the pivot to success. On realisation of step 5 (intelligent performance), an organisation would be expected to have embraced the market leading approaches to maximising project performance and be well placed to achieve market leading returns on investment and margin. The paper advocates that organisations should: • Adopt a 3-click rule to project information • Send the right action, to the right person, at the right time • Blend human and data insights by quantifying perceptions and makinginsights actionable • Automate Project Data Analytics into the working rhythm of project delivery This paper is deliberately aimed at the project professional and not the data science community. It simplifiesthe typical technical jargon around analytics and provides a wide variety of examples, tips and graphics that the project professional can easily relate to. *For clarity, the five step framework is solely the work of Petrofac and no third party organisation has either been asked to comment on or endorse this. No direct link should be inferred between the Petrofac framework and the Association of Project Management, the only connection is the author's involvement in both.

Key success factors in Business Intelligence,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878681775&doi=10.37380%2fjisib.v1i1.19&partnerID=40&md5=3b062115cde1f23409c75a753fd2a5ae,"Business Intelligence can bring critical capabilities to an organization, but the implementation of such capabilities is often plagued with problems. Why is it that certain projects fail, while others succeed? The aim of this article is to identify the factors that are present in successful Business Intelligence projects and to organize them into a framework of critical success factors. A survey was conducted during the spring of 2011 to collect primary data on Business Intelligence projects. Findings confirm that Business Intelligence projects are wrestling with both technological and non-technological problems, but the non-technological problems are found to be harder to solve as well as more time consuming than their counterparts. The study also shows that critical success factors for Business Intelligence projects are different from success factors for Information Systems projects in general. Business Intelligences projects have critical success factors that are unique to the subject matter. Major differences can be found primarily among non-technological factors, such as the presence of a specific business need and a clear vision to guide the project. Success depends on types of project funding, the business value provided by each iteration in the project and the alignment of the project to a strategic vision for Business Intelligence at large. Furthermore, the study provides a framework for critical success factors that, explains sixty-one percent of variability of success for projects. Areas which should be given special attention include making sure that the Business Intelligence solution is built with the end users in mind, that the Business Intelligence solution is closely tied to the company's strategic vision and that the project is properly scoped and prioritized to concentrate on the best opportunities first.",Capacity management - Capacity planning,Capacity management,Capacity planning

Very few real-world experiments have been carried out and quantification and characterization of the response is a difficult task. Nevertheless it will be a necessary tool for portfolio management of consumers in a DR framework. In this paper we develop methods to quantify and characterize the amount of DR in a load. The contribution to the aggregated load from each household is quantified on a daily basis, showing the potential variability of the response in time. Clustering on the average values and standard deviation of the contribution regroups households with the same average response.

For article purpose realization, the paper proposes a complex toolkit for modeling the innovative projects risks in the direction of their impact on performance indicators in scenarios, which involves the implementation of the following stages of modeling: Stage 1. Collection and processing of project data; Stage 2. Evaluation of innovation project efficiency indicators; Stage 3. Formation and assessment of many risks of innovation project by components, nature and impact strength; Stage 4. Modeling of innovative project development scenarios. The implemented set of models makes possible to compare all components of efficiency and riskiness, which determine the integrated aggregate level of project risk by components of life cycle risks, target project risks and scenarios depending on environmental factors and managers propensity to take risks, and solves the problem of positioning the real indicators state of innovation project efficiency in a comparative dynamic context based on three-level assessment, due to structural elements of risks and identification of possible and promising deadlines and time horizons by stages of the project life cycle, critical paths and reserves which allow us to achieve the main goal of improving the innovative projects implementation efficiency. © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

Dealing with that fact is non more an option. Companies have to reexamine the way they do business in order to gain benefits from big data. Consequently, they have to review their approach of managing projects in order to create the added value. For the purpose of assessing this issue, we have adopted a research approach built on two phases. In the first, we have performed a systematic literature review to spot the gaps in the current research. The results have revealed that so far, no scientific work has discussed how companies can create business value through project management in a big data context. These results have also shown significant contributions of the research community on how big data contributes to value creation in organizations.

Unfortunately, hitting this sweet spot often proves to be a difficult process, particularly in more turbulent environments. This article aims to understand the forces at work in the design process of these metrics using two starkly contrasting case studies involving the design of dashboards for IT departments, specifically for IT governance which concerns the alignment between business and IT. The first case explores metrics design for an organization with low external and high internal turbulence (a German insurance company), the second contrasting case focuses on a similar metrics design process but now for an organization facing low internal turbulence and high external turbulence (an African national government). Our findings suggest how the source of project turbulence impacts the success of the metrics design process, the bias towards more inward-focused or outward-focused metrics, and the overall outcomes of the project. © 2012 IEEE.",Governance - Alignment with organizational governance,Governance,Alignment with organizational governance

Predicting which projects will not be completed by the expected end date (time overrun) and within the allotted number of hours (man-hours overrun) helps manage company's employee utilization and avoids overscheduling. This study applied a data analytics framework on IT project management dataset to predict the project completion time and overruns (in man-hours). We used linear regression and classification models to predict projects' performance and analyze the underlying factors causing project delay. Our predictive analysis used 131 variables which included 536 tasks, 138 resources, 69371 employee hours, 72 contractors that were assigned to 434 projects. We also calculated two new variables closeness and betweenness among project team members. Results showed that Decision Tree outperformed SVM, ANN, LDA, and logistic regression in predicting man-hours overrun. In addition, preliminary Social Network Analysis (SNA) indicates that Avg-closeness and Avg-betweenness did not improve prediction on the overall amount of time and man-hours overrun but improve the prediction on time overrun, but task, resource and contractor assignments variables were significant at p-value of .01.

In this paper, we explore the effects of common project management practices that contribute to these problems and suggest a better alternative that can utilize resources more effectively. Our alternative approach uses (a) a thorough analysis of risks affecting activities in a project plan (i.e., the root factors leading to cost and time overruns), and (b) an optimization of the resources allocated to each activity in the project plan to maximize the probability of on time and within budget project completion. One key feature of our method is its capability to adapt and learn the risk factors affecting activities during the course of the project, enabling project managers to reallocate resources dynamically to ensure a better outcome given the updated risk profile. We use simulations to test the performance of our optimization algorithm and to gain insights into the benefits of adaptive re-planning. © 2007 IEEE.",Risk management - Risk analysis,Risk management,Risk analysis

Software project failures are often a result of insufficient and ineffective risk information regarding the future. To overcome this, software risk prediction should be performed in advance to allow project managers insight into providing more valuable information for decision making, such as scope coverage, resource allocation, and schedule changes. In this research, we propose a risk prediction model from the perspective of quality using a software repository. We evaluated the risk threat level by mapping some defect attributes that exist in the defect lifecycle, defined their risk threat transition states, and applied a Markov chain for predicting the potential risk level. We evaluated the proposed approach using practical real-industry mobile software projects. The experimental results confirm that our approach is applicable to software threat risk estimation. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Risk management - Risk analysis,Risk management,Risk analysis

Cognitive psychology and knowledge-based applications engineering are at the heart of AI. AI-assisted quicker computing approaches are being used to address complex difficulties. Simultaneously, new, and more complicated issues emerge, which are difficult for the human mind to understand and envision, and which are far from being solved.

The most important aspect of a business analysis, therefore, lies with the analysis of the risks and their associated returns. The basic objective of an organization is to increase the productivity to grab more market share. But the problem is that market risk is inherent in all projects and, by nature, it is stochastic. It can hardly be avoided but can be mitigated at most through diversification. Through Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the systematic or un-diversifiable risks can be described and measured by beta, ?. In order to mitigate the risk, investments are to be made on a combination of different projects or portfolio of projects rather than a single project. Through ?-hedging, a proper hedging strategy can be developed to reduce the systematic risk. But it has also been observed that the concept of CAPM has been plagued by the stochastic nature of the economy. Therefore, in the first part of this work, the systematic risk has been evaluated through time-varying ? analysis. According to the results of the hedge performance of individual projects of the portfolio, it will be possible to select/rank the projects according to their risk-return trade-off capacity and in the second part, the Technique for Order Preference using Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), one of the most important MCDM techniques, has been merged with CAPM in order to provide a more justified selection procedure of projects considering four more attributes, other than risk, which may confirm a more realistic basis of creating the portfolio for increasing organizational effectiveness.",Risk management - risk identification,Risk management,Risk identification

We focus on the main artifact of the non-verbal communication, namely project structure.

The survey resulted in a list of recommendations on how to build the project artifacts to make them clear, intuitive, and logical.

Big Data in Portfolio Allocation: A New Approach to Successful Portfolio Optimization,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088398199&doi=10.3905%2fjfds.2019.1.045&partnerID=40&md5=7594e41db9cab0aa632ac4907db2dbce,"In the classic mean-variance portfolio theory as proposed by Harry Markowitz, the weights of the optimized portfolios are directly proportional to the inverse of the asset correlation matrix. However, most contemporary portfolio optimization research focuses on optimizing the correlation matrix itself, and not its inverse. In this article, the author demonstrates that this is a mistake. Specifically, from the Big Data perspective, she proves that the inverse of the correlation matrix is much more unstable and sensitive to random perturbations than is the correlation matrix itself. As such, optimization of the inverse of the correlation matrix adds more value to optimal portfolio selection than does optimization of the correlation matrix. The author further shows the empirical results of portfolio reallocation under different common portfolio composition scenarios. The technique outperforms traditional portfolio allocation techniques out of sample, delivering nearly 400% improvement over the equally weighted allocation over a 20-year investment period on the S&P 500 portfolio with monthly reallocation. In general, the author demonstrates that the correlation inverse optimization proposed in this article significantly outperforms the other core portfolio allocation strategies, such as equally weighted portfolios, vanilla mean-variance optimization, and techniques based on the spectral decomposition of the correlation matrix. The results presented in this article are novel in the data science space, extend far beyond financial data, and are applicable to any data correlation matrixes and their inverses, whether in advertising, healthcare, or genomics. © 2019 Pageant Media Ltd.",Strategic alignment - Portfolio optimization or balance,Strategic alignment,Portfolio optimization or balance

An appropriate project categorization helps understand portfolio’s structure and enables proper project portfolio selection (PPS). In practice, project categorization is, however, conducted in intuitive approaches. Furthermore, little attention has been given to project categorization methods in the project management literature. The purpose of this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners with a data-driven project categorization process designed for PPS. Design/methodology/approach: The suggested process was modeled considering the main characteristics of project categorization systems revealed from the literature. The clustering analysis is used as the core-computing technology, allowing for an empirically based categorization. This study also presents a real-world case study in the automotive industry to illustrate the proposed approach.

Existing techniques focus on retrospective reporting and understanding the underlying relationships to make informed decisions. Although machine learning algorithms have been widely used in addressing problems within various contexts (e.g., streamlining the design of construction projects), limited studies have evaluated pre-existing machine learning methods within the delivery of construction projects. Due to this, the current research aims to contribute further to this convergence between artificial intelligence and the execution construction project through the evaluation of a specific set of machine learning algorithms. This study proposes a machine learning-based data-driven research framework for addressing problems related to project analytics. It then illustrates an example of the application of this framework. In this illustration, existing data from an open-source data repository on construction projects and cost overrun frequencies was studied in which several machine learning models (Python’s Scikit-learn package) were tested and evaluated. The data consisted of 44 independent variables (from materials to labour and contracting) and one dependent variable (project cost overrun frequency), which has been categorised for processing under several machine learning models. These models include support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour, random forest, stacking (ensemble) model and artificial neural network. Feature selection and evaluation methods, including the Univariate feature selection, Recursive feature elimination, SelectFromModel and confusion matrix, were applied to determine the most accurate prediction model. This study also discusses the generalisability of using the proposed research framework in other research contexts within the field of project management. The proposed framework, its illustration in the context of construction projects and its potential to be adopted in different contexts will significantly contribute to project practitioners, stakeholders and academics in addressing many project-related issues. © 2022, The Author(s).",Strategic alignment - Selection,Strategic alignment,Selection
"A new strategic approach for R&D
project portfolio selection using
efficiency-uncertainty maps",,"Purpose – New business practices and the globalization of markets force firms to take innovation as the
fundamental pillar of their competitive strategy. Research and Development (R&D) plays a vital role in innovation. As technology advances and product life cycles become shorter, firms rely on R&D as a strategy to invigorate innovation. R&D project portfolio selection is a complex and challenging task. Despite the management’s efforts to implement the best project portfolio selection practices, many projects continue to fail or miss their target. The problem is that selecting R&D projects requires a deep understanding of strategic vision and technical capabilities. However, many decision-makers lack technological insight or strategic vision. This article aims to provide amethod to capitalize on the expertise of R&Dprofessionals to assistmanagers inmaking informed and effective decisions. It also provides a framework for aligning the portfolio of R&D projects with the organizational vision and mission.

Findings – The proposed strategy plane helps decision-makers align R&D project portfolios with their strategies to combine a strategic view and numerical analysis in this research. The proposed strategy plane consists of four areas: Exploitation Zone, Challenge Zone, Desperation Zone and Discretion Zone. Mapping the project into this strategic plane would help decision-makers align their project portfolio according to the corporate perspectives.
Originality/value – The new approach combines the efficiency and uncertainty dimensions in portfolio selection into an integrated framework that: (i) provides a complete representation of the stochastic decision-making processes, (ii) models the endogenous uncertainty inherent in the project selection process and (iii) proposes a computationally practical and visually unique solution procedure for classifying desirable and undesirable R&D projects.

The number of studies on the strategic process has significantly increased over the past decade. Despite this increasing trend, previous studies have not been yet critically evaluated. This paper, therefore, aims to presents a comprehensive review of project portfolio selection and optimization studies focusing on the evaluation criteria, selection approach, solution approach, uncertainty modeling, and applications. This study reviews more than 140 papers on project portfolio selection research topic to identify the gaps and to present future trends. The findings show that not only the financial criteria but also social and environmental aspects of project portfolios have been focused by researchers in project portfolio selection in recent years. In addition, meta-heuristics and heuristics approach to finding the solution of mathematical models have been the critical research by scholars. Expert systems, artificial intelligence, and big data science have not been considered in project portfolio selection in the previous studies. In future, researchers can investigate the role of sustainability, resiliency, foreign investment, and exchange rates in project portfolio selection studies, and they can focus on artificial intelligence environments using big data and fuzzy stochastic optimization techniques. © 2019 The Author(s).",Value management - Criteria for setting value objectives,Value management,Criteria for setting value objectives
