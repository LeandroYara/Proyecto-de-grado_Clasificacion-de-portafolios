A Dashboard to Support Management of Business Analytics Capabilities,Santiago Rivera D.; Shanks G.,2015,22,"Business analytics (BA) systems create value and provide competitive advantage for organisations. They involve technology and data infrastructure, BA capabilities and business processes that provide useful insights and support decision-making. To provide value and competitive advantage, BA capabilities should be valuable, rare and inimitable, and have organisational support (VRIO). In this paper, we develop and evaluate a prototype dashboard for the VRIO assessment of BA capabilities. The dashboard is intended to support the strategic management of BA capabilities. We discuss implications of the prototype dashboard for researchers and practitioners and suggest directions for future research. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",10.1080/12460125.2015.994335,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924258742&doi=10.1080%2f12460125.2015.994335&partnerID=40&md5=539d4ba1d88d21fe983f62cdaa48b6d1,2-s2.0-84924258742,Alineación con la estrategia y objetivos,Journal of Decision Systems,Cómo alinearse con la estrategía a partir de la analítica?,,28,"Library and Information Sciences 	2022 	Q1

"Project portfolio selection problems: A review of models, uncertainty approaches, solution techniques, and case studies",Mohagheghi V.; Mousavi S.M.; Antuchevi?ien? J.; Mojtahedi M.,2019,18,"Project portfolio selection has been the focus of many scholars in the last two decades. The number of studies on the strategic process has significantly increased over the past decade. Despite this increasing trend, previous studies have not been yet critically evaluated. This paper, therefore, aims to presents a comprehensive review of project portfolio selection and optimization studies focusing on the evaluation criteria, selection approach, solution approach, uncertainty modeling, and applications. This study reviews more than 140 papers on project portfolio selection research topic to identify the gaps and to present future trends. The findings show that not only the financial criteria but also social and environmental aspects of project portfolios have been focused by researchers in project portfolio selection in recent years. In addition, meta-heuristics and heuristics approach to finding the solution of mathematical models have been the critical research by scholars. Expert systems, artificial intelligence, and big data science have not been considered in project portfolio selection in the previous studies. In future, researchers can investigate the role of sustainability, resiliency, foreign investment, and exchange rates in project portfolio selection studies, and they can focus on artificial intelligence environments using big data and fuzzy stochastic optimization techniques. © 2019 The Author(s).",10.3846/tede.2019.11410,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076850409&doi=10.3846%2ftede.2019.11410&partnerID=40&md5=86ac10e37faf87ad45e68f8d8aa2ab99,2-s2.0-85076850409,Criterios para establecer objetivos de valor,Technological and Economic Development of Economy,Cómo la analítica aporta en la selección de proyectos?,Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,59,"Finance	 2022 	Q2",,,
A decision-making framework for project portfolio planning at Intel Corporation,Sampath S.; Gel E.S.; Fowler J.W.; Kempf K.G.,2015,12,"The work we describe addresses the problem of deciding between project-funding opportunities under budget and headcount constraints. Although the projects lead to products that yield revenue in the market, complex interactions between the projects and products make the selection of a portfolio difficult. Furthermore, the senior managers in the company have a wealth of business intuition that can inform the required decisions. We combine modeling, simulation, and optimization techniques to provide a set of the best portfolios possible from the proposed projects and resulting products. We also provide a rich set of analysis and visualization tools for the decision makers to use in exploring the suggested portfolios and applying their intuition to make the final selection.

Big data analytics in innovation processes: which forms of dynamic capabilities should be developed and how to embrace digitization?,Capurro R.; Fiorentino R.; Garzella S.; Giudici A.,2021,7,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze, from a dynamic capabilities perspective, the role of big data analytics in supporting firms' innovation processes. 
Design/methodology/approach: Relevant literature is reviewed and critically assessed. An interpretive methodology is used to analyze empirical data from interviews of big data analytics experts at firms within digitally related sectors. 
Findings: This study shows how firms leverage big data to gain “richer” and “deeper” data at the inter-sections between the digital and physical worlds. The authors provide evidence for the importance of counterintuitive strategies aimed at developing innovative products, services or solutions with characteristics that may initially diverge, even significantly, from established customer/user needs. 
Practical implications: The authors’ findings offer insights to help practitioners manage innovation processes in the physical world while taking investments in big data analytics into account.

A Data-driven project categorization process for portfolio selection,"El bok G., Berrado A.",2022,2,"Purpose: Categorizing projects allows for better alignment of a portfolio with the organizational strategy and goals. An appropriate project categorization helps understand portfolio’s structure and enables proper project portfolio selection (PPS). In practice, project categorization is, however, conducted in intuitive approaches. Furthermore, little attention has been given to project categorization methods in the project management literature. The purpose of this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners with a data-driven project categorization process designed for PPS. Design/methodology/approach: The suggested process was modeled considering the main characteristics of project categorization systems revealed from the literature. The clustering analysis is used as the core-computing technology, allowing for an empirically based categorization. This study also presents a real-world case study in the automotive industry to illustrate the proposed approach. Findings: This study confirmed the potential of clustering analysis for a consistent project categorization. The most important attributes that influenced the project grouping have been identified including strategic and intrinsic features. The proposed approach helps increase the visibility of the portfolio’s structure and the comparability of its components. Originality/value: There is a lack of research regarding project categorization methods, particularly for the purpose of PPS. A novel data-driven process is proposed to help mitigate the issues raised by prior researchers including the inconsistencies, ambiguities and multiple interpretations related to the taken-for-granted categories. The suggested approach is also expected to facilitate projects evaluation and prioritization within appropriate categories and contribute in PPS effectiveness. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/JM2-10-2020-0257,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109023786&doi=10.1108%2fJM2-10-2020-0257&partnerID=40&md5=d11438e8df2d0cbd807c2367b594e208,2-s2.0-85109023786,Selección,"Journal of Modelling in

How to measure and manage the UK Government’s major project portfolio,"Bourne M., Anker D., Chambers G., Torjai L.",2020,1,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to stimulate changes to the way performance data is used to improve performance taking the government’s use of project data as an example. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses systems theory to review the way the government’s major projects portfolio should be analysed. Findings: This paper concludes that broader engagement in the analytics process should be considered as a way of improving insights and learning from reviews. The paper suggests that report alone has limited value. Research limitations/implications: By taking a systems approach, this study raises questions about the methods used to manage data analysis and system improvements. Systems thinking is a useful tool to consider applications such as the performance of the government’s project portfolio, but there are many other approaches that can be applied. Practical implications: This study makes very specific recommendations around the roles and responsibilities of people and teams at different levels in the system. Roles and activities are described together with recommendations about interfering in and overreaching these roles and activities. Originality/value: This paper synthesises a number of systems approaches together with a view of why “we measure” to create a framework for analysing approaches to performance improvement.

Machine learning in project analytics: a data-driven framework and case study,Uddin S.; Ong S.; Lu H.,2022,1,"The analytic procedures incorporated to facilitate the delivery of projects are often referred to as project analytics. Existing techniques focus on retrospective reporting and understanding the underlying relationships to make informed decisions. Although machine learning algorithms have been widely used in addressing problems within various contexts (e.g., streamlining the design of construction projects), limited studies have evaluated pre-existing machine learning methods within the delivery of construction projects. Due to this, the current research aims to contribute further to this convergence between artificial intelligence and the execution construction project through the evaluation of a specific set of machine learning algorithms. This study proposes a machine learning-based data-driven research framework for addressing problems related to project analytics. It then illustrates an example of the application of this framework. In this illustration, existing data from an open-source data repository on construction projects and cost overrun frequencies was studied in which several machine learning models (Python’s Scikit-learn package) were tested and evaluated. The data consisted of 44 independent variables (from materials to labour and contracting) and one dependent variable (project cost overrun frequency), which has been categorised for processing under several machine learning models. These models include support vector machine, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour, random forest, stacking (ensemble) model and artificial neural network. Feature selection and evaluation methods, including the Univariate feature selection, Recursive feature elimination, SelectFromModel and confusion matrix, were applied to determine the most accurate prediction model. This study also discusses the generalisability of using the proposed research framework in other research contexts within the field of project management. The proposed framework, its illustration in the context of construction projects and its potential to be adopted in different contexts will significantly contribute to project practitioners, stakeholders and academics in addressing many project-related issues. © 2022, The Author(s).",10.1038/s41598-022-19728-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138126779&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-022-19728-x&partnerID=40&md5=41090bb4d7a9c0ca75e1b7c4a5712b8a,2-s2.0-85138126779,Selección,Scientific Reports,,Nature Publishing Group,282,Multidisciplinary 2022 Q1,,,

"A new strategic approach for R&D
project portfolio selection using
efficiency-uncertainty maps","Mehdi Namazi; 
Madjid Tavana; 
Emran Mohammadi;
Ali Bonyadi Naeini ",2022,,"Purpose – New business practices and the globalization of markets force firms to take innovation as the
fundamental pillar of their competitive strategy. Research and Development (R&D) plays a vital role in innovation. As technology advances and product life cycles become shorter, firms rely on R&D as a strategy to invigorate innovation. R&D project portfolio selection is a complex and challenging task. Despite the management’s efforts to implement the best project portfolio selection practices, many projects continue to fail or miss their target. The problem is that selecting R&D projects requires a deep understanding of strategic vision and technical capabilities. However, many decision-makers lack technological insight or strategic vision. This article aims to provide amethod to capitalize on the expertise of R&Dprofessionals to assistmanagers inmaking informed and effective decisions. It also provides a framework for aligning the portfolio of R&D projects with the organizational vision and mission.
Design/methodology/approach – This article proposes a new strategic approach for R&D project portfolio
selection using efficiency-uncertainty maps.
Findings – The proposed strategy plane helps decision-makers align R&D project portfolios with their strategies to combine a strategic view and numerical analysis in this research. The proposed strategy plane consists of four areas: Exploitation Zone, Challenge Zone, Desperation Zone and Discretion Zone. Mapping the project into this strategic plane would help decision-makers align their project portfolio according to the corporate perspectives.
Originality/value – The new approach combines the efficiency and uncertainty dimensions in portfolio selection into an integrated framework that: (i) provides a complete representation of the stochastic decision-making processes, (ii) models the endogenous uncertainty inherent in the project selection process and (iii) proposes a computationally practical and visually unique solution procedure for classifying desirable and undesirable R&D projects.

Unified business intelligence ecosystem: A project management approach to address business intelligence challenges,"Ramesh B., Ramakrishna A.",2018,5,"The purpose of this paper is to explore a concept that improves the success rate of Business Intelligence projects by looking at it as an ecosystem rather than standalone project. This paper discusses the importance on Business Intelligence (BI) initiatives and today's challenges in implementing them. The concentration is on using proven practices of project management to reduce the failure rates of the Business Intelligence projects by evaluating currently existing Information Technology (IT) project process, Business Intelligence frameworks and a Project Vulnerability process in order to adopt some of the best project management practices that works for Business Intelligence projects. The paper studies currently existing processes and introduces a new concept which henceforth will be termed as 'Unified Business Intelligence Ecosystem' framework (UBIE). This research is based on various project management frameworks, those are proven to increase the efficiency of projects, and far-ranging sources of research on nature of Business Intelligence projects, personal observations and real-world Business Intelligence consulting experience. Research limitations/implications: Business Intelligence is a constantly developing field. Partial standardization and extensive availability and access to Business Intelligence resources has created many definitions and buzz words in the industry. The assumptions described in this research might seem arguable given the reader's experience in this field. Originality/value: The paper presents a different perspective to view and manage Business Intelligence projects.

Simulation of adaptive project management analytics,"Deleris L.A., Bagchi S., Kapoor S., Katircioglu K., Lam R., Buckley S.",2007,4,"Typically, IT projects are delivered over-budget and behind schedule. In this paper, we explore the effects of common project management practices that contribute to these problems and suggest a better alternative that can utilize resources more effectively. Our alternative approach uses (a) a thorough analysis of risks affecting activities in a project plan (i.e., the root factors leading to cost and time overruns), and (b) an optimization of the resources allocated to each activity in the project plan to maximize the probability of on time and within budget project completion. One key feature of our method is its capability to adapt and learn the risk factors affecting activities during the course of the project, enabling project managers to reallocate resources dynamically to ensure a better outcome given the updated risk profile. We use simulations to test the performance of our optimization algorithm and to gain insights into the benefits of adaptive re-planning. © 2007 IEEE.",10.1109/WSC.2007.4419859,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-49749113737&doi=10.1109%2fWSC.2007.4419859&partnerID=40&md5=3916699bc04b2d319ff443c6807fe3e9,2-s2.0-49749113737,Medición o cuantificación de riesgos,Proceedings of the 2007 Winter Simulation Conference,,IEEE,N/A,Rank: B,,,

According to previous surveys on the state of data science project management, there is a significant gap between technical and organizational processes. In this article we present new empirical data from a survey to 237 data science professionals on the use of project management methodologies for data science. We provide additional profiling of the survey respondents' roles and their priorities when executing data science projects. Based on this survey study, the main findings are: (1) Agile data science lifecycle is the most widely used framework, but only 25% of the survey participants state to follow a data science project methodology. (2) The most important success factors are precisely describing stakeholders' needs, communicating the results to end-users, and team collaboration and coordination.

Paradise by the dashboard light: Designing governance metrics in turbulent environments,Borgman H.P.; Heier H.; Bahli B.,2012,0,"One of the emerging sweet-spots in business intelligence (BI) and business performance management (BPM) projects is the design of metrics (dashboards) in such a way that they balance the need for ""inward focused"" operational management with the need for ""outward-focused"" strategic management. Unfortunately, hitting this sweet spot often proves to be a difficult process, particularly in more turbulent environments. This article aims to understand the forces at work in the design process of these metrics using two starkly contrasting case studies involving the design of dashboards for IT departments, specifically for IT governance which concerns the alignment between business and IT. The first case explores metrics design for an organization with low external and high internal turbulence (a German insurance company), the second contrasting case focuses on a similar metrics design process but now for an organization facing low internal turbulence and high external turbulence (an African national government). Our findings suggest how the source of project turbulence impacts the success of the metrics design process, the bias towards more inward-focused or outward-focused metrics, and the overall outcomes of the project. © 2012 IEEE.",10.1109/HICSS.2012.465,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857946391&doi=10.1109%2fHICSS.2012.465&partnerID=40&md5=38fcdbdbbdbc5c645b589a3cd627b01a,2-s2.0-84857946391,Gobierno del portafolio,2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,,IEEE,N/A,Rank: A,,,

Predicting Project Outcomes with the Association of Project Management,Robertson A.,2022,,"Project professionals place great value in accurately predicting project outcomes. Itis therefore unsurprising that there has been a rapid acceptance of a new suite of tools promising to forecastproject outcomes better than ever before. Within a few years the use of project data analytics has become widespread throughout project delivery organisations; they have become the norm. Most closely associated with dashboards,project data analytics is transforming projects' ability to see problems sooner and act quicker. Project data analytics however has not yet been 'professionalised'. No single organisation has yet solved how to holistically get the very best out of analytics to deliver more predictable projects, but many are trying across multiple industries. Some organisations have great solutions and ideas, but itis not yet encoded in how the profession delivers. Petrofac as part of the Project Data Analytics Task Force [1&2], a cross industry working group, have collaborated with the Association of Project Management (APM) [3] to publish a ground-breaking guide[4] designed to help project delivery organisations get started in project data analytics. In addition, a five step framework*is offered which is designed for project delivery organisations who are further long their journey with analytics. This framework recommends the steps organisations can take to improve their project predictability from basic systems, through to dashboards and onto machine learning and artificial intelligence. It also references the capabilities organisations need to consider forthe benefits to become embedded. The paper explores how superior project performance is best achieved when project data analytics is blended with the insights and actions our people bring to delivering projects; to improve resultsthis blend of data and people is noted as being essential. The paper highlights this as the most significant factor as to why data analytics programmesmay not bring the value organisations expect and why step 4 (automated performance) of the model is seen as the pivot to success. On realisation of step 5 (intelligent performance), an organisation would be expected to have embraced the market leading approaches to maximising project performance and be well placed to achieve market leading returns on investment and margin. The paper advocates that organisations should: • Adopt a 3-click rule to project information • Send the right action, to the right person, at the right time • Blend human and data insights by quantifying perceptions and makinginsights actionable • Automate Project Data Analytics into the working rhythm of project delivery This paper is deliberately aimed at the project professional and not the data science community. It simplifiesthe typical technical jargon around analytics and provides a wide variety of examples, tips and graphics that the project professional can easily relate to. *For clarity, the five step framework is solely the work of Petrofac and no third party organisation has either been asked to comment on or endorse this. No direct link should be inferred between the Petrofac framework and the Association of Project Management, the only connection is the author's involvement in both.

A framework for big data integration within the strategic management process based on a balanced scorecard methodology,Alnoukaria M.,2021,4,"The purpose of this research is to study the impact of big data initiatives on strategic management processes. While the majority of strategic management disciplines have had research dedicated to the use of strategic management theories to understand how big data affect organizational performance, the body of research on big data lacks academic work capable of examining how to integrate big data into the strategic management process. The main contributions of this work are: (1) it highlights the strategic use of big data; (2) it analyses the main frameworks/models proposed by scholars that support the use of big data as a strategic management tool, and outlines this research gap; and (3) it proposes a new framework that integrates big data within the strategic management process based on a balanced scorecard methodology. © 2021",10.37380/jisib.v1i1.693,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106651173&doi=10.37380%2fjisib.v1i1.693&partnerID=40&md5=927624aa9a488b55f192c456a2e69112,2-s2.0-85106651173,Alineación con la estrategia y objetivos,Journal of Intelligence Studies in Business,,Halmstad University,13,"Management Science and Operations Research 	2022	 Q4

Integrating a Project Risk Model into a BI Architecture,"Nunes M., Abreu A., Bagnjuk J., Saraiva C., Viana H.",2022,,"In today’s unpredictable and disruptive business landscape organizations face challenges that severely threatens their existence. To efficiently respond such challenges organizations must craft strategies to become more data-informed, agile, adaptative, and flexible. Integrating dynamic data analytical models in organizational structures to collect, analyze and interpret business data, is critical to organizations because it enables them to make more data-informed decisions and reduce bias in decision-making. In this work is illustrated the integration of a heuristic project risk-model used to identify project critical success factors into a typical organizational business intelligence architecture. The proposed integration enables organizations to efficiently and in a timely manner identify project collaborative risks by addressing people, environment, and tools, and generate actionable project-related knowledge that helps organizations to efficiently respond business challenges and achieve sustainable competitive advantages. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-94617-3_29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128956819&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-94617-3_29&partnerID=40&md5=c8c022a17fc042c41535d4b475d8bb04,2-s2.0-85128956819,Alineación con la estrategia y objetivos,"Lecture Notes in Information Systems and Organisation book series

Big Data in Portfolio Allocation: A New Approach to Successful Portfolio Optimization,Aldridge I.,2019,7,"In the classic mean-variance portfolio theory as proposed by Harry Markowitz, the weights of the optimized portfolios are directly proportional to the inverse of the asset correlation matrix. However, most contemporary portfolio optimization research focuses on optimizing the correlation matrix itself, and not its inverse. In this article, the author demonstrates that this is a mistake. Specifically, from the Big Data perspective, she proves that the inverse of the correlation matrix is much more unstable and sensitive to random perturbations than is the correlation matrix itself. As such, optimization of the inverse of the correlation matrix adds more value to optimal portfolio selection than does optimization of the correlation matrix. The author further shows the empirical results of portfolio reallocation under different common portfolio composition scenarios. The technique outperforms traditional portfolio allocation techniques out of sample, delivering nearly 400% improvement over the equally weighted allocation over a 20-year investment period on the S&P 500 portfolio with monthly reallocation. In general, the author demonstrates that the correlation inverse optimization proposed in this article significantly outperforms the other core portfolio allocation strategies, such as equally weighted portfolios, vanilla mean-variance optimization, and techniques based on the spectral decomposition of the correlation matrix. The results presented in this article are novel in the data science space, extend far beyond financial data, and are applicable to any data correlation matrixes and their inverses, whether in advertising, healthcare, or genomics. © 2019 Pageant Media Ltd.",10.3905/jfds.2019.1.045,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088398199&doi=10.3905%2fjfds.2019.1.045&partnerID=40&md5=7594e41db9cab0aa632ac4907db2dbce,2-s2.0-85088398199,Optimización,Journal of Financial Data Science,Optimización del portafolio a partir del análisis de los datos?,With intelligence,10,"Artificial Intelligence	 2022	 Q2

Using analytics to predict project management success,"Summerfield N., Zhang J., Motiwalla L., Mai T., Mazza K.",2018,1,"IT projects normally face time and cost overruns challenges. Predicting which projects will not be completed by the expected end date (time overrun) and within the allotted number of hours (man-hours overrun) helps manage company's employee utilization and avoids overscheduling. This study applied a data analytics framework on IT project management dataset to predict the project completion time and overruns (in man-hours). We used linear regression and classification models to predict projects' performance and analyze the underlying factors causing project delay. Our predictive analysis used 131 variables which included 536 tasks, 138 resources, 69371 employee hours, 72 contractors that were assigned to 434 projects. We also calculated two new variables closeness and betweenness among project team members. Results showed that Decision Tree outperformed SVM, ANN, LDA, and logistic regression in predicting man-hours overrun. In addition, preliminary Social Network Analysis (SNA) indicates that Avg-closeness and Avg-betweenness did not improve prediction on the overall amount of time and man-hours overrun but improve the prediction on time overrun, but task, resource and contractor assignments variables were significant at p-value of .01. The models we used helps identify key predictors of project performance and provide insights into the company's resource management.

Use of Artificial Intelligence Smart Tools in Projects,Lokhande A.,2022,0,"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gotten a lot of press and attention. Learning and adapting through constant algorithmic interventions aid in the development of a firm grasp of the situation at hand, as well as the handling of more difficult challenges as they arise. Cognitive psychology and knowledge-based applications engineering are at the heart of AI. AI-assisted quicker computing approaches are being used to address complex difficulties. Simultaneously, new, and more complicated issues emerge, which are difficult for the human mind to understand and envision, and which are far from being solved. Dynamic developments in global technical, economic, political, and environmental settings provide insurmountable challenges to corporate executives and strategists. Projects and project management are used to carry out business plans and government welfare goals. Throughout the project's timeframe, project managers must cope with restrictions. Regardless of methodology, predictive or iterative, the existence of various stakeholders and managing their requirements creates a slew of issues for the project manager and team.

Evaluation Criteria of Project Risk and Decision Making Through Beta Analysis and TOPSIS Towards Achieving Organizational Effectiveness,"Chakraborty B., Das S.",2019,,"Value of a project of an organization is primarily determined by two major factors – risk and return. The most important aspect of a business analysis, therefore, lies with the analysis of the risks and their associated returns. The basic objective of an organization is to increase the productivity to grab more market share. But the problem is that market risk is inherent in all projects and, by nature, it is stochastic. It can hardly be avoided but can be mitigated at most through diversification. Through Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the systematic or un-diversifiable risks can be described and measured by beta, ?. In order to mitigate the risk, investments are to be made on a combination of different projects or portfolio of projects rather than a single project. Through ?-hedging, a proper hedging strategy can be developed to reduce the systematic risk. But it has also been observed that the concept of CAPM has been plagued by the stochastic nature of the economy. Therefore, in the first part of this work, the systematic risk has been evaluated through time-varying ? analysis. According to the results of the hedge performance of individual projects of the portfolio, it will be possible to select/rank the projects according to their risk-return trade-off capacity and in the second part, the Technique for Order Preference using Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), one of the most important MCDM techniques, has been merged with CAPM in order to provide a more justified selection procedure of projects considering four more attributes, other than risk, which may confirm a more realistic basis of creating the portfolio for increasing organizational effectiveness.",10.1007/978-981-13-8581-0_13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068602908&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-13-8581-0_13&partnerID=40&md5=2c27eef5a8199346c897e4303c6a7a77,2-s2.0-85068602908,Identificación de riesgos,Communications in Computer and Information Science,,Springer Nature Singapore,62,"Computer Science (miscellaneous)	 2022	 Q4",,,

Business Value Creation Through Project Management Based on Big Data Approach,"Chennouk H., Ziyati E.H., El Bhiri B.",2022,,"In the era of big data, the high level of businesses’ digitalization, and new technology development in various fields, awash companies in a flood of massive amounts of data. Dealing with that fact is non more an option. Companies have to reexamine the way they do business in order to gain benefits from big data. Consequently, they have to review their approach of managing projects in order to create the added value. For the purpose of assessing this issue, we have adopted a research approach built on two phases. In the first, we have performed a systematic literature review to spot the gaps in the current research. The results have revealed that so far, no scientific work has discussed how companies can create business value through project management in a big data context. These results have also shown significant contributions of the research community on how big data contributes to value creation in organizations.

Probabilistic Approach to Predicting Risk in Software Projects Using Software Repository Data,"Jeon C., Kim N., In H.P.",2015,1,"Although the factors that need to be focused on for a successful software project appear to be difficult to define, risk management has become one of the key activities for achieving such success because significant risk is involved in each software development phase. Software project failures are often a result of insufficient and ineffective risk information regarding the future. To overcome this, software risk prediction should be performed in advance to allow project managers insight into providing more valuable information for decision making, such as scope coverage, resource allocation, and schedule changes. In this research, we propose a risk prediction model from the perspective of quality using a software repository. We evaluated the risk threat level by mapping some defect attributes that exist in the defect lifecycle, defined their risk threat transition states, and applied a Markov chain for predicting the potential risk level. We evaluated the proposed approach using practical real-industry mobile software projects. The experimental results confirm that our approach is applicable to software threat risk estimation. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",10.1142/S0218194015500151,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84945907018&doi=10.1142%2fS0218194015500151&partnerID=40&md5=dc62753d8b689a3d578a365055007e6b,2-s2.0-84945907018,Medición o cuantificación de riesgos,International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering,Predicción del riesgo basado en datos?,,38,"Artificial Intelligence 2022 Q4

We focus on the main artifact of the non-verbal communication, namely project structure. In particular, we surveyed three sources of information on how to structure projects: common management methodologies, community best practices, and data sharing platforms. The survey resulted in a list of recommendations on how to build the project artifacts to make them clear, intuitive, and logical.

Key success factors in Business Intelligence,Adamala S.; Cidrin L.,2011,36,"Business Intelligence can bring critical capabilities to an organization, but the implementation of such capabilities is often plagued with problems. Why is it that certain projects fail, while others succeed? The aim of this article is to identify the factors that are present in successful Business Intelligence projects and to organize them into a framework of critical success factors. A survey was conducted during the spring of 2011 to collect primary data on Business Intelligence projects. Findings confirm that Business Intelligence projects are wrestling with both technological and non-technological problems, but the non-technological problems are found to be harder to solve as well as more time consuming than their counterparts. The study also shows that critical success factors for Business Intelligence projects are different from success factors for Information Systems projects in general. Business Intelligences projects have critical success factors that are unique to the subject matter. Major differences can be found primarily among non-technological factors, such as the presence of a specific business need and a clear vision to guide the project. Success depends on types of project funding, the business value provided by each iteration in the project and the alignment of the project to a strategic vision for Business Intelligence at large. Furthermore, the study provides a framework for critical success factors that, explains sixty-one percent of variability of success for projects. Areas which should be given special attention include making sure that the Business Intelligence solution is built with the end users in mind, that the Business Intelligence solution is closely tied to the company's strategic vision and that the project is properly scoped and prioritized to concentrate on the best opportunities first.",10.37380/jisib.v1i1.19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878681775&doi=10.37380%2fjisib.v1i1.19&partnerID=40&md5=3b062115cde1f23409c75a753fd2a5ae,2-s2.0-84878681775,Gestión de capacidades,Journal of Intelligence Studies in Business,Identificación de factores de éxito para d determinar que proyectos seleccinoar en el portafolio de Analítica?,Halmstad University,13,"Management Science and Operations Research 	2022 Q4",,,

Business intelligence capabilities as facilitators to achieve organizational agility,"Kuilboer J.-P., Ashrafi N., Lee O.-K.D.",2016,4,"Today's business environment is characterized by fast and unexpected changes, many of which are driven by technological advancement. In such environment, the ability to respond effectively and adapt to the new requirements is not only desirable but essential to survive.

Two key distinctions of the approach are that 1) standard business documents are the user interface, and 2) a ""schema-less"" XML database enables flexible integration of technology information for use by both humans and machines in a highly dynamic environment. The implementation utilizes patent-pending NASA software called the NASA Program Management Tool (PMT) and its underlying ""schema-less"" XML database called Netmark. Initial benefits of PMT include elimination of discrepancies between business documents that use the same information and ""paperwork reduction"" for program and project management in the form of reducing the effort required to understand standard reporting requirements and to comply with those reporting requirements.

"Artificial intelligence, big data, strategic flexibility, agility, and organizational resilience: A conceptual framework based on existing literature","Ciampi F., Marzi G., Rialti R.",2018,4,"In today’s economically turbulent times, it is imperative that organizations remain flexible and resilient in order to adapt themselves to an ever-changing environment. To facilitate this, organizations should rely upon pliant structures of information, whilst simultaneously continuing to incorporate more rigid infrastructures in order to allow for the collection and analysis of large amounts of both internal and external data. This juxtaposition gives rise to the need for a trade-off. While academic literature has stressed that information systems may represent a burden for organizations pursuing strategic agility, flexibility, and organizational resilience, this paper highlights the ways in which Analytical, Automatic, Adaptive, and Agile information systems - or Big Data Analytics (BDA) capable information systems - may be helpful. In particular, this paper proposes BDA capable information systems, tied with artificial intelligence capabilities, as a trade-off solution. Alongside this, it also proposes some further implications of the topic for scholars and practitioners. © 2018 IADIS Press.

Capabilities to achieve business intelligence agility - Research model and tentative results,"Knabke T., Olbrich S.",2016,2,"The class of business intelligence (BI) systems is used as a basis for decision making in most big organizations. Extensive initiatives have been launched to accomplish adequate and timely decision support as an important factor to achieve and sustain competitive advantage. Within turbulent market environments it is challenging to keep up a distinguishable long-term strategy while quickly reacting to changing circumstances. This area of conflicts holds particularly true for BI as it is originally used to retrospectively reflect an organization's performance and built upon stability and efficiency. Therefore, we investigate how dynamic BI capabilities, i.e. adoption of assets, market understanding and intimacy as well as business operations, impact the agility of BI. We approach our goal from a dynamic capability perspective. Starting from a literature review of dynamic capabilities of information systems (IS) and BI, we propose hypotheses to connect dynamic BI capabilities and BI agility. Derived hypotheses based on existing literature will be tested in our prospective research agenda. A small pre-study showed promising results. In-memory (IM) technology seems to be a technology enabler for agile BI.

Achieving decision-making quality and organisational agility in innovation portfolio management in telecommunication 4.0,"Kurniawan R., Hamsalb M.",2019,2,"Innovation portfolio management (IPM) decision-making capability has become one of the most important organisational competencies to survive and be sustained in the hyper-competitive market of the telecommunications equipment industry. As Telecommunication 4.0 brings up new challenges and complexities created by open innovation and integrated hardware and software, there is a necessity to further demonstrate how organisations leverage networking with partners and exploit internal organisational structural flexibility to fully gain IPM decision-making quality and organisational agility. This study aims to explore how IPM decision-making quality and organisational agility are influenced by a business intelligence system with the capability of providing profound market knowledge and orchestrating the organisations' networking capabilities in leveraging external capabilities with internal factors embedded in a nimble organisational structure that subsequently influences decision-making accuracy. Furthermore, the relationship of antecedents-a business intelligence system, networking capability, and nimble organisational structure-is elaborated in our conceptual research model. Exploratory case studies with four telecommunication equipment companies in Indonesia and a literature review are used to examine the relationship between IPM decision-making quality antecedents. Deriving from information processing theory, dynamic capability, and resource-based theory, the originality of this study lies in how organisations exploit not only internal resources and flexible organisational structure, but also in how it accesses, configures, and leverages external network resources embedded in business partners to come up with full access to IPM decision-making quality in an open innovation era. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078291308&partnerID=40&md5=487ce02c1dcadec0d092d6ed04478f9d,2-s2.0-85078291308,,,,,,,,,
Deep learning for decision making and the optimization of socially responsible investments and portfolio,"Vo N.N.Y., He X., Liu S., Xu G.",2019,51,"A socially responsible investment portfolio takes into consideration the environmental, social and governance aspects of companies. It has become an emerging topic for both financial investors and researchers recently. Traditional investment and portfolio theories, which are used for the optimization of financial investment portfolios, are inadequate for decision-making and the construction of an optimized socially responsible investment portfolio. In response to this problem, we introduced a Deep Responsible Investment Portfolio (DRIP) model that contains a Multivariate Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory neural network, to predict stock returns for the construction of a socially responsible investment portfolio. The deep reinforcement learning technique was adapted to retrain neural networks and rebalance the portfolio periodically. Our empirical data revealed that the DRIP framework could achieve competitive financial performance and better social impact compared to traditional portfolio models, sustainable indexes and funds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.dss.2019.113097,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069803699&doi=10.1016%2fj.dss.2019.113097&partnerID=40&md5=84486f00e58eea319ebf1004673a5c6e,2-s2.0-85069803699,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative planning and risk management of agile software development,Ghane K.,2017,13,"The Agile Software Development methodologies has enjoyed a widespread acceptance in the software development industry. While iterative and incremental approach of agile methodologies are the main attractions, at the same time they make estimation and predictability of agile software projects a challenge. Delivering workable software in short cycles helps with collecting more heuristic data as compared to traditional waterfall methodologies. Such data can be used as quantitative metrics for time and effort estimation that in turn can help with risk mitigation and risk avoidance. Although traditional agile formulations and recommendations place emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes and tools, this paper considers processes and tools essential in agile processes of today's complex software systems and distributed teams. Emphasis on processes and tools enables agile software projects to produce project metrics that can be effectively used in predictive analytics and risk management. The system that is introduced here emphasizes on quantitative approach to agile project planning and introduces a risk management model that produces risk metrics that are used to help with risk avoidance and risk mitigation. The risk metrics and the project simulation model are used to adjust project factors such as time, cost and scope during lifespan of project. Such adjustments come from recommender system that proposes changes to a wide range of project parameters for risk mitigation and risk avoidance. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/TEMSCON.2017.7998362,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028543368&doi=10.1109%2fTEMSCON.2017.7998362&partnerID=40&md5=17a03abedd1a6aebacba5e0a16b42935,2-s2.0-85028543368,,,,,,,,,
Estimating the value of decisions relating to managing and developing software-intensive products and projects,"Mendes E., Turhan B., Rodríguez P., Freitas V.",2015,11,"The software industry's current decision-making relating to product/project management and development is largely done in a value neutral setting, in which cost is the primary driver for every decision taken.

Therefore, to remain competitive, innovative and to grow, companies must change from cost-based decision-making to value-based decision-making where the decisions taken are the best for that company's overall value creation. Our vision to tackle this problem and to provide a solution for value estimation is to employ a combination of qualitative and machine learning solutions where a probabilistic model encompassing the knowledge from different stakeholders will be used to predict the overall value of a given decision relating to product management and development.

However, approaches aiming at designing efficient development processes such as the value stream analysis only analyze development projects retrospectively as well as periodically and therefore do not continuously improve the efficiency of the respective projects themselves. Therefore, a concept is needed to anticipate deviations from the target process and thus inefficiencies within development projects by aid of predictive analytics. To derive a predictive analytics model, neural networks are applied to identify the impact of deviation indicators on the efficiency dimensions time, costs and quality of an activity. Upon reversion, it is possible to monitor the deviation indicators and use the respective indicator values as input for the neural networks. Based on the identified impact of the indicator on the efficiency dimensions, the neural network is able to predict the final values of an activity in terms of time, cost and quality. By comparing the predicted values with the defined target values, the deviation can be determined and preventive measures can be implemented to eliminate inefficiencies. © 2016 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.",10.1109/PICMET.2016.7806640,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016214645&doi=10.1109%2fPICMET.2016.7806640&partnerID=40&md5=d3466b803925dcdbf4aeaaa72f8e463b,2-s2.0-85016214645,,,,,,,,,

Visual analytics in enterprise architecture management: A systematic literature review,"Jugel D., Sandkuhl K., Zimmermann A.",2017,3,"In times of dynamic markets, enterprises have to be agile to be able to quickly react to market influences. Due to the increasing digitization of products, the enterprise IT often is affected when business models change. Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) targets a holistic view of the enterprise’ IT and their relations to the business. However, Enterprise Architectures (EA) are complex structures consisting of many layers, artifacts and relationships between them. Thus, analyzing EA is a very complex task for stakeholders. Visualizations are common vehicles to support analysis. However, in practice visualization capabilities lack flexibility and interactivity. A solution to improve the support of stakeholders in analyzing EAs might be the application of visual analytics. Starting from a systematic literature review, this article investigates the features of visual analytics relevant for the context of EAM. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",10.1007/978-3-319-52464-1_10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010430864&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-52464-1_10&partnerID=40&md5=141defbbf869f456c56821ab5a3e8920,2-s2.0-85010430864,,,,,,,,,
Data Visualization on the Life Cycle of Science and Technology Projects,Wang Z.; Wang D.; Li Q.,2021,1,"Science and technology project management system is a fundamental tool in modern governments which is required for the effective management of research arrangement, financial resources, project implement and researcher communication. However, despite its successful development, there are still many visualized application scenarios that require customized methods to explore data integration, and to establish visualization of project life cycle. To that end, this paper focuses on science and technology project data model and business data model based on four phases of management workflow. Furthermore, we propose a project life cycle model, a three-layered data structure for combining all the data of a project, to facilitate dynamic integration among project data and business data. In addition, we present a system architecture including its functional layers and data flow, which improves project life cycle visualization, and especially displays the details of project and business data in a prototype web page. This research contributes to project management business visualization by providing data models and system architecture, and helps project managers in making decisions, managing business operations and tracking the progress of tasks. © 2021 IEEE.",10.1109/ICCCBDA51879.2021.9442519,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107708054&doi=10.1109%2fICCCBDA51879.2021.9442519&partnerID=40&md5=693ffc64445e1801ef7c810071331cf5,2-s2.0-85107708054,,,,,,,,,

Business Intelligence Solution in Project Monitoring and Control; [Solucão de Business Intelligence na Monitorizacão e Controlo de Projetos],Rosa M.F.; Alturas B.,2020,0,"Due to the need to control and monitor the performance of projects and the inherent need for project managers to provide feedback on the status of their project(s), this study focuses mainly on the planning of a Business Intelligence solution, as an aid in the monitoring and control of projects. In this sense, the EVM (Earned Value Management) technique is used as a method recommended by PMBOK and it is effective in controlling and monitoring projects, to identify the best indicators and develop the proposed Business Intelligence solution for this research. Based on the questionnaires answered by project managers from different sectors and with different experiences, and based on the literature on EVM and dashboards, it was possible to formulate a Business Intelligence solution that allows project managers to evaluate, through a single screen, the status of their project(s). The developed dashboard refers to a dashboard of tactical typology, since its purpose is to measure progress and optimize the process through indicators of action and result, in summary / detailed form with the purpose of improving the analysis by a BI Portal. © 2020 AISTI.",10.23919/CISTI49556.2020.9140916,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089021021&doi=10.23919%2fCISTI49556.2020.9140916&partnerID=40&md5=f670dd674d5304afb347a4e1df03fb69,2-s2.0-85089021021,,,,,,,,,
Quantifying the benefits of investment portfolio optimisation versus prioritisation for asset intensive organisations,"Tamimi I., Beullens P., Sadnicki S.",2016,,"Historically, many organisations have made investment decisions using a conventional ranking and prioritisation process. When prioritising, a fixed score is determined for each investment. This can be a measure of the investment's financial return (e.g. Net Present Value), or possibly a measure of the risk that the investment will mitigate for the organisation (risk score). During prioritisation, the portfolio of investments is ranked by that fixed score, and then those investments that can be executed within the budgetary constraints are selected. Mathematical optimisation using linear programming can improve on prioritisation results and achieve higher value outcomes whilst honouring multiple constraints (e.g. financial, service level, resources, timing, inter-project dependencies, and risk tolerances). Whilst individual organisations have reported significant benefits of using optimisation techniques these results are naturally specific to their operating context. This study seeks to generalise these results and quantify the value obtained by using optimisation techniques on portfolios of asset investments. © 2016 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Applying process mining to support management of predictive analytics/data mining projects in a decision making center,"Escobar M.O.S., Espinosa R.L., Espinosa J.M.M., Noguez Monroy J.J., Solar G.V.",2019,,"A Decision Making Centers (DMC) Environment facilitates the understanding of complex problems and simplifies the decision making process of policy makers and stakeholders by playing out several what if scenarios. One of the key elements in this environment is the management of Predictive Analytics and Data Mining (PADM) techniques required for real-time and accurate representation of data in scenarios. However, there has been a gap in understanding the best practices that facilitate the execution of PADM in environments such as a DMC. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Specifically, we apply process mining techniques to reveal: 1) process flow and executed activities in PADM projects and 2) The relationship and time distribution of activities within a PADM project execution. To this end two successful projects were analyzed in order to find relationships among activities and time metrics during execution. The present study aims to support managers in the execution of large scale PADM projects. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/ICSAI48974.2019.9010135,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081986202&doi=10.1109%2fICSAI48974.2019.9010135&partnerID=40&md5=9f180437a05f169861bb6f6d3eee7700,2-s2.0-85081986202,,,,,,,,,
Design of a process mining alignment method for building big data analytics capabilities,"Pfahlsberger L., Mendling J., Eckhardt A.",2021,,"Process mining is a big data analytics technique that supports business process management in an evidence-based way. Nowadays, companies struggle to build the required capabilities that lift process mining beyond technical proof-of-concept implementations. As research on process mining is largely limited to algorithm design and project management recommendations, current research does not understand well how process mining and complementary resources and capabilities can be aligned. By understanding those interrelations, companies learn to leverage their organizational potential during the execution of process mining more effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we address this research gap by using the design science research approach to develop a process mining alignment method. Our method supports companies mapping their individual technical requirements of process mining to their underlying organizational resources. We evaluate our method through a series of interviews with IT consultants. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

Agile CMII: A Methodology for Assessing Social Project Impacts Within Agile Contexts,"Fernandes F., Belfort R., Campos F.",2021,,"Agile methodologies have been gaining more and more momentum since its inception in the beginning of the year 2000s. Its inherent iterative and user-centered behavior helps teams to dynamically prioritize, plan and execute work packages, which tend to be appropriate for innovative projects where problem-solution duo co-evolve throughout time. Thus, agile adoption, which naturally began within software development teams, has now been widespread throughout other corporate departments and diverse segments. The present work continues an ongoing research over CMII (Conceição Moura Impact Index), which is an analytics model that combines NPS (net promote score), OKRs (objectives and key results) and SROI (social return over investment) methods for measuring project impacts. Specifically, this current research proposes an integration of Scrum (an agile representative) with CMII model. The main objective is to make the model adoptable and practical for agile teams on social projects. Overall, it functions under Scrum’s sprint ceremonies – planning, daily meeting, review and retrospective –, where CMII KPIs and methods will be timely handled or executed, respectively. The main result is a project assessment methodology – comprised of phases, methods and metrics –, making it applicable for professionals when measuring the overall impact of their initiatives. It aims to dynamically informs strategic decision-making and links it to projects’ operational aspects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-80876-1_45,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112301056&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-80876-1_45&partnerID=40&md5=00325b2e92d01ceb7093d8d0b504d02e,2-s2.0-85112301056,,,,,,,,,
Risk Management in Analytics Solutions Integration and Deploy: Case Study in a Brazilian Financial Institution,"de Sousa P.E.L., Costa J.P.V., Monteiro S.B.S., Souza J.C.F.",2022,,"The research seeks to propose a risk management approach for the main risks identified in the integration and implementation of Analytics solutions in a large banking institution in Brazil. Various approaches and techniques were applied during the development of the research. Among them: construction of the SIPOC matrix, survey of the main risks from the literature, validation of risks via semi-structured interviews and applying the FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) technique to prioritize risks and manage priority risks. The results indicated that by managing the 3 highest priority risk events, it is fundamentally possible to mitigate the risks with medium, high, and higher risk indexes (RPN) of the process. Such risks are associated with talent retention and training, lack of alignment between clients proposing solutions and recurring changes in the scope of projects. Project managers in Analytics should assess whether their integration/implementation processes foresee preventive, corrective and/or mitigating actions for the associated risk events foreseen in the discovery of this research.

The model consists of three phases and uses an easily communicated four-field model for mapping existing data and discovering new possibilities. The model helps to identify what datasets the organization could use in analytics and to assess them according to their strategic importance.
